        <h1>MILA</h1>
      <p>I think about her almost every day. How can I ever forget her? Mila was my childhood best friend.</p>
      <p>I spent every Summer in my grandmother's village. Mila lived in the same neighborhood and our relatives had known each other ever since they could remember. Almost from the moment I first went to the village, Mila became my best friend. </p>
      <p>She was a mischievous girl with a happy, cheerful smile, long blond hair and big blue eyes. She looked like an angel, but seep down, she was a tomboy at heart. I was more timid and shy, with brown hair and green eyes. We were almost complete opposites, but together we were inseparable. </p>
      <p>All Summer long, from morning till night, for 10 years we were always together. It was a seaside village and we often went swimming in the warm, salty sea or lay on the cliffs, basking under the warm rays of the sun. Every moment I spent in the dusty, boring city, I would be looking forward to the Summer and seeing my best friend again. </p>
      <p>Then, something happened. When we were 14, we had a serious quarrel. It was over something really stupid. The reason was a boy called Vince. He was very handsome and drove all the girls crazy. He was three years older than us, but Mila and I were head over heels in love with him. </p>
      <p>Of course, he chose Mila. </p>
      <p>I was so disappointed. We had a big argument and I stopped talking to her. Long before the Summer ended, I gathered my things and went back to the city. I didn't see Mila again that year. </p>
      <p>Every day, I thought about her and how we could make it up. I knew how silly I had been and I waited for the months, weeks and days to pass before I could see her again and say sorry.</p>
      <p>The next Summer, I returned to the village. Even though it was already late in the evening when I arrived, I went straight to our place by the sea. Somehow, I knew she would be there.</p>
      <p>I saw her sitting on the cliffs. She had her back to me. The sea was surging and waves were crashing against the rocks. For a moment, I was afraid she would still be angry with me, but when I shouted, "Mila!" she turned to look at me and her face broke into a smile. I ran over to her. </p>
      <p>"I've been waiting for you," she said. </p>
      <p>I tried to hug her, but for some reason she moved away. Then, I noticed how nervous she seemed. </p>
      <p>"What's wrong?" I asked.</p>
      <p>"You have to get out of here," she replied.</p>
      <p>"Why?"</p>
      <p>"Please, I beg you," she said nervously. "Just go. I'll see you soon. Not now, but soon".</p>
      <p>She wouldn't explain why, but she insisted that I go and just waited until I left. </p>
      <p>When I got back to the house, my grandmother was waiting for me. She was a little angry and asked me where I had been. I told her that I met Mila. Grandma paused for a long time and looked at me dumbfounded. Then she felt my forehead. </p>
      <p>"What did I say wrong?" I asked, puzzled. </p>
      <p>My grandmother sat me down and said, "I'm sorry to tell you this, but... Mila died. It happened a month ago. She drowned." </p>
      <p>I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I had just seen her with my own eyes. I had just talked to her​​. She was dead?</p>
      <p>It turned out that, a month earlier, Mila had been walking along the cliffs when a big wave came along and swept her into the sea. Three days later, her body was found washed up on the shore. </p>
      <p>Then I realized that the place where we loved hanging out was the exact place where Mila had been swept off the cliffs and drowned. That night, the waves were crashing against the cliffs. I would have been swept into the sea just like Mila. That's why she was telling me to leave. She came back to save my life.  </p>
      <p>Although it's been almost a year since that time, I'm still afraid of the last thing Mila said to me: "I'll see you soon. Not now, but soon"</p>
